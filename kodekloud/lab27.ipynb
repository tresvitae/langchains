    "# Lab 27: Web-Based RAG System - Real-Time Information Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Build a complete RAG system that processes live web content for up-to-date information retrieval\n",
    "- Load and extract content from web pages using WebBaseLoader for HTML processing\n",
    "- Implement the same RAG pipeline architecture with web-based content sources\n",
    "- Understand how to adapt RAG systems for dynamic, frequently-updated content\n",
    "- Compare web-based RAG with document-based RAG for different use cases\n",
    "- Build systems that can answer questions about current events and online information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lab extends the RAG system architecture to work with web content, enabling real-time information retrieval from online sources. You'll learn how to process HTML content, handle web-specific challenges, and create question-answering systems that can work with the latest information from websites. This is essential for building AI systems that need access to current, frequently-updated information rather than static documents."
