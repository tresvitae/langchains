    "# Lab 30: Wikipedia Tool Integration - Knowledge Base Access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Integrate external knowledge sources using LangChain tools\n",
    "- Use Wikipedia as a structured knowledge base for AI applications\n",
    "- Configure and customize Wikipedia API wrapper for optimal results\n",
    "- Understand tool architecture and standardized interfaces in LangChain\n",
    "- Process and limit content from large knowledge sources\n",
    "- Build foundation for agent-based systems with external tool access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lab introduces LangChain's tool ecosystem by integrating Wikipedia as an external knowledge source. You'll learn how to create standardized tool interfaces that can be used by agents, chains, or directly in applications. This represents a key pattern in modern AI systems - accessing external, up-to-date information beyond the training data of language models. Wikipedia serves as an excellent example of structured, reliable external knowledge that can enhance AI capabilities."
