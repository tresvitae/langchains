    "# Lab 31: Tavily Search Integration - Real-Time Web Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Integrate real-time web search capabilities using Tavily Search API\n",
    "- Access current information from across the internet for AI applications\n",
    "- Configure and use professional search tools optimized for AI systems\n",
    "- Process and analyze search results with structured data formats\n",
    "- Understand the difference between knowledge bases (Wikipedia) and web search\n",
    "- Build foundation for AI agents with real-time information gathering capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lab introduces Tavily Search, a powerful web search API specifically designed for AI applications. Unlike static knowledge sources like Wikipedia, Tavily provides real-time access to current information from across the web, making it ideal for questions about recent events, current data, and rapidly changing information. You'll learn how to integrate this tool into LangChain workflows, process search results, and understand when to use web search versus other knowledge sources in AI systems."
