lab1 + lab2 - Invoking LLMs
These two labs introduce how to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) using LangChain. 
- **Lab 1** focuses on the basics of sending a prompt to an LLM and receiving a response, covering the simplest invocation patterns and API usage.
- **Lab 2** builds on Lab 1 by introducing more advanced invocation options, such as customizing model parameters, handling errors, and managing response formats. The key difference is that Lab 2 explores more robust and production-ready ways to invoke LLMs, while Lab 1 is about the fundamentals.

lab3 - Prompt Template
This lab demonstrates how to use prompt templates to structure and reuse prompts efficiently. You will learn how to define templates with variables, fill them dynamically, and understand the benefits of templating for consistency and maintainability in LLM applications.

lab4 - Few-Shot Prompt Template
This lab extends the concept of prompt templates by introducing few-shot learning. You will see how to provide examples within your prompts to guide the LLM towards better and more contextually relevant outputs. The focus is on constructing prompts that include demonstrations for improved model performance.

lab5 + lab6 + lab7 - Parsing Model Output
These three labs cover techniques for parsing and handling the output generated by LLMs.
- **Lab 5** introduces basic parsing strategies, such as extracting structured data from plain text responses.
- **Lab 6** explores more advanced parsing, including error handling and validation of model outputs.
- **Lab 7** focuses on integrating parsing logic into end-to-end workflows, ensuring that model outputs can be reliably used in downstream applications. The progression from Lab 5 to Lab 7 moves from simple extraction to robust, production-grade output handling.

lab8 + lab9 + lab10 - LangChain Debugging and Monitoring
These three labs focus on different approaches to debugging, monitoring, and observing LangChain operations for better development and production insights.
- **Lab 8** demonstrates global debugging using `set_debug(True)` which provides comprehensive tracing of all chain operations including timing, input/output flow, and internal processing steps. It also showcases the modern pipe operator (`|`) syntax for chain composition.
- **Lab 9** focuses on the `verbose=True` parameter in LLMChain, which provides chain-specific logging without global settings. This approach gives you detailed output for individual chains while maintaining control over what gets logged.
- **Lab 10** introduces callback handlers, specifically `StdOutCallbackHandler`, for real-time monitoring of chain execution. This provides the most flexible approach to observability, allowing custom handling of execution events and integration with external monitoring systems. The progression from Lab 8 to Lab 10 moves from global debugging to targeted verbose logging to customizable callback-based monitoring.

lab11 + lab12 + lab13 + lab14 - LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) Fundamentals
These four labs introduce the modern LangChain Expression Language and different execution methods for chains.
- **Lab 11** covers basic chain composition using the pipe operator (`|`) and introduces schema inspection capabilities. You'll learn to build fundamental chains with prompt → model → parser flow and understand input/output schemas for better debugging and validation.
- **Lab 12** demonstrates streaming functionality using the `stream()` method for real-time response processing. This lab shows how to provide better user experience by displaying responses as they arrive, rather than waiting for complete generation.
- **Lab 13** introduces batch processing with the `batch()` method for efficiently handling multiple queries simultaneously. This approach optimizes performance when processing multiple similar requests.
- **Lab 14** extends batch processing with advanced techniques and best practices for handling different types of batch inputs and optimizing batch operations for better performance and throughput.

lab15 + lab16 - Advanced LangChain Composition Patterns
These two labs explore sophisticated chain composition techniques for building complex workflows.
- **Lab 15** demonstrates custom function integration using `RunnableLambda` to wrap Python functions for use in chains. You'll learn to combine LLM responses with custom logic, create complex processing pipelines, and visualize chain structure with graph representation.
- **Lab 16** showcases advanced chain composition using `RunnablePassthrough` for multi-step content generation workflows. This lab builds a complete content pipeline (input → title → outline → blog → summary) demonstrating data flow management between dependent chain operations and creating sophisticated automated content generation systems.

lab17 + lab18 - Memory Management and Configuration
These two labs introduce advanced LangChain features for conversation management and dynamic chain configuration.
- **Lab 17** focuses on implementing short-term memory in conversational AI using `MessagesPlaceholder`. You'll learn how to inject conversation history into prompts, maintain context across multiple interactions, and build AI systems that remember previous exchanges. This lab demonstrates the difference between contextless and contextual conversations, showing how memory enables more natural dialogue flow.
- **Lab 18** demonstrates configurable fields using `ConfigurableField` for dynamic runtime configuration of chain components. You'll learn to create flexible chains that can switch between different models (like GPT-3.5-turbo vs GPT-4) without recreating the entire chain structure. This lab shows how to build adaptable systems that can be reconfigured on-the-fly for different use cases or performance requirements.
