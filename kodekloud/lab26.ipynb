    "# Lab 26: Complete PDF RAG System - Document Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Build a complete end-to-end RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for PDF documents\n",
    "- Load and process PDF documents using PyPDFLoader for text extraction\n",
    "- Implement intelligent text chunking strategies for optimal retrieval performance\n",
    "- Create vector embeddings and store them in Chroma vector database\n",
    "- Build a question-answering chain that retrieves relevant context and generates accurate answers\n",
    "- Understand the complete RAG pipeline: Load → Split → Embed → Store → Retrieve → Generate\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lab demonstrates a production-ready RAG system that can answer questions about PDF documents by combining document retrieval with LLM generation. You'll build a complete pipeline that processes PDF content, creates a searchable knowledge base, and provides accurate answers based on document context. This represents the culmination of all previous RAG concepts in a practical, real-world application."
