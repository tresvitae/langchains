    "# Lab 33: Custom Tool Development - Flight Status Tool with Chain Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Create custom tools using LangChain's `@tool` decorator\n",
    "- Build domain-specific tools for specialized use cases\n",
    "- Integrate custom tools with LangChain chains and prompts\n",
    "- Process tool output through language models for enhanced responses\n",
    "- Understand tool metadata and standardized interfaces\n",
    "- Build complete workflows combining tools, prompts, and LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lab demonstrates custom tool development by creating a flight status tool and integrating it with LangChain workflows. You'll learn how to build your own tools for specific business needs, then combine them with language models to create intelligent, context-aware responses. This represents the progression from using existing tools to developing custom solutions that can be seamlessly integrated into LangChain's ecosystem."
